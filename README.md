### Babel
Babel is employed to transpile ES6+ JavaScript and React JSX code to a format that can be understood by older browsers. It ensures that our codebase remains modern while still supporting legacy systems.

### Gulp
Gulp is our chosen toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in our development workflow. It helps in the compilation of SCSS files, minification of CSS and JavaScript, among other tasks.
